## What is Million.js?

Million.js is an extremely fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that makes [React components](https://react.dev) up to [_**70% faster**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) framework? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why do I need this?

Million.js works with React. Million.js makes creating web apps just as easy (It's just wrapping a [React](https://react.dev) component!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React ([_try it out here_](https://demo.million.dev))

**TL;DR:** Imagine [React](https://react.dev) components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

## Installation

The Million.js CLI will automatically install the package and configure your project for you.

```bash
npx million@latest
```

[**‚Üí View the installation guide**](https://million.dev/docs/install)

## Codebase

This repo is a "mono-repo" with modules. Million.js ships as one NPM package, but has first class modules for more complex, but important extensions. Each module has its own folder in the `/packages` directory.

You can also track our progress through our [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/aidenybai/projects/5/views/1?layout=roadmap).

## Acknowledgments

Million.js takes heavy inspiration from the following projects:

- [`blockdom`](https://github.com/ged-odoo/blockdom) ([G√©ry Debongnie](https://github.com/ged-odoo))
  Thank you to G√©ry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.
- [`voby`](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) ([Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato))
  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
- [Hack the Wave](https://hackthewave.com) ([Melinda Chang](https://github.com/melindachang)) for their homepage.
- [`react`](https://react.dev) and [`turbo`](https://turbo.build) for their documentation. Many parts of the current Million.js documentation are grokked and modified from theirs.
- [`ivi`](https://github.com/localvoid/ivi), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [and more](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2021/table_chrome_96.0.4664.45.html)

Million.js is being used at companies like [Wyze](https://wyze.com) and [Dimension](https://dimension.dev), as well as open source work like [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), [TinyPages](https://github.com/Borrus-sudo/tinypages), [and more](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/network/dependents).
