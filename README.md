# CrossPong# CrossPong

Welcome to CrossPong! This project is a delightful rendition of the classic Pong game, developed as our final year student project. It's a testament to the joy of simple, engaging gameplay and the added twist of modern web technologies.

## About the Project

CrossPong expands on the classic Pong experience with four unique maps, each representing a half-court. When combined with an opponent's half, they form a complete playing field. Each map is distinct, with its own theme and custom game elements like balls, paddles, and special powers, enriching the traditional Pong formula.
